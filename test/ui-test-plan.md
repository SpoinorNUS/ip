# UI Test Plan

This plan covers the command-line interaction documented for Turtley. Each test case starts a fresh program session. The persistence cases run in order: test case 1 creates the save file, and test case 2 verifies loading it before clearing the list. Delete data/turtley.txt before starting a new full run. The `inputs` and `expected_outputs` arrays in the JSON block are aligned by position: each expected output must appear after the corresponding input's earlier output.

## Test case 1: To-do, deadline, and event workflow

Aim: Verify that ordinary to-dos, deadlines, and events are accepted, displayed with the correct type icons and details, retained in insertion order, counted correctly, and saved after successful list mutations.

Inputs:

```text
todo read book
deadline return book /by 2026-06-06
event project meeting /from 06-08-2026 14:00 /to 06-08-2026 16:00
todo join sports club
mark 1
mark 4
todo borrow book
list
deadline return book /by 07-06-2026
event project meeting /from 10-08-2026 1400 /to 10-08-2026 1600
bye
```

Expected output: The program prints the corresponding confirmation for each command, including the following important results:

```text
[T][ ] borrow book
[D][ ] return book (by: 2026-06-06)
[E][ ] project meeting (from: 2026-08-06 14:00 to: 2026-08-06 16:00)
1.[T][X] read book
2.[D][ ] return book (by: 2026-06-06)
3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: 2026-08-06 14:00 to: 2026-08-06 16:00)
4.[T][X] join sports club
5.[T][ ] borrow book
[D][ ] return book (by: 2026-06-07)
[E][ ] project meeting (from: 2026-08-10 14:00 to: 2026-08-10 16:00)
Now you have 7 tasks in the list.
```

The executable expected-output list is kept below so the `test-ui` skill can run this case without guessing which output belongs to each command.

## Test case 2: Load saved tasks and clear list

Aim: Verify that tasks saved by the previous session are restored on startup, that a missing to-do name is rejected, and that the list can be cleared for later test cases.

Inputs:

```text
list
todo
delete 1
delete 1
delete 1
delete 1
delete 1
delete 1
delete 1
list
bye
```

Expected output:

```text
Here are the tasks in your list:
 1.[T][X] read book
 2.[D][ ] return book (by: 2026-06-06)
 3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: 2026-08-06 14:00 to: 2026-08-06 16:00)
 4.[T][X] join sports club
 5.[T][ ] borrow book
 6.[D][ ] return book (by: 2026-06-07)
 7.[E][ ] project meeting (from: 2026-08-10 14:00 to: 2026-08-10 16:00)
Invalid format. Use: todo <description> o/T\>
Task list empty. Good job! Here's a cookie. o/T\>
```
## Test case 3: Error messages

Aim: Verify that invalid commands, task numbers, and structured task formats use the custom Turtley error message suffix.

Inputs:

```text
deadline /by tomorrow
event /from 2pm /to 3pm
mark nope
unmark nope
mark 1
unmark 1

unknown command
deadline malformed /by 2026-02-30
event malformed /from 31-02-2026 /to 01-03-2026
event compact time /from 31-12-2026 2300 /to 01-01-2027 0030
delete 1
bye
```

Expected output:

```text
Invalid format. Use: deadline <description> /by <date> o/T\>
Invalid format. Use: event <description> /from <start> /to <end> o/T\>
Please provide a valid task number. o/T\>

Invalid date/time format. Use yyyy-MM-dd, dd-MM-yyyy, yyyy/MM/dd, dd/MM/yyyy, yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm, dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm, yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm, dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm, yyyy-MM-dd HHmm, dd-MM-yyyy HHmm, yyyy/MM/dd HHmm, or dd/MM/yyyy HHmm. o/T\>
Got it. I've added this task:
  [E][ ] compact time (from: 2026-12-31 23:00 to: 2027-01-01 00:30)
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
 Noted. I've removed this task:
   [E][ ] compact time (from: 2026-12-31 23:00 to: 2027-01-01 00:30)
 Now you have 0 tasks in the list.
Bye. See you around!
```

## Test case 4: Delete task workflow

Aim: Verify that a task is deleted by its one-based number, its details and updated task count are shown, later tasks are renumbered, and the updated list is saved.

Inputs:

```text
todo read book
deadline return book /by 2026-06-06
event project meeting /from 06-08-2026 14:00 /to 06-08-2026 16:00
todo join sports club
todo borrow book
mark 1
mark 2
list
delete 3
list
bye
```

Expected output for the relevant commands:

```text
 Here are the tasks in your list:
 1.[T][X] read book
 2.[D][X] return book (by: 2026-06-06)
 3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: 2026-08-06 14:00 to: 2026-08-06 16:00)
 4.[T][ ] join sports club
 5.[T][ ] borrow book
 Noted. I've removed this task:
   [E][ ] project meeting (from: 2026-08-06 14:00 to: 2026-08-06 16:00)
 Now you have 4 tasks in the list.
 1.[T][X] read book
 2.[D][X] return book (by: 2026-06-06)
 3.[T][ ] join sports club
 4.[T][ ] borrow book
```

## Test case 5: Timecheck workflow

Aim: Verify that timecheck lists only deadlines and events on or before a supplied date/time, handles a date with no matches, rejects invalid input, and leaves the task list unchanged.

Inputs:

```text
event planning /from 06/08/2026 09:00 /to 06/08/2026 10:00
timecheck 2026-06-30
timecheck 2026-08-27 12:00
timecheck 2025-01-01
timecheck invalid
delete 5
bye
```

Expected output for the relevant commands:

```text
Got it. I've added this task:
  [E][ ] planning (from: 2026-08-06 09:00 to: 2026-08-06 10:00)
Now you have 5 tasks in the list.
 Here are the deadline and event tasks on or before 2026-06-30:
 2.[D][X] return book (by: 2026-06-06)
 Here are the deadline and event tasks on or before 2026-08-27 12:00:
 2.[D][X] return book (by: 2026-06-06)
 5.[E][ ] planning (from: 2026-08-06 09:00 to: 2026-08-06 10:00)
 Here are the deadline and event tasks on or before 2025-01-01:
None! o/T\>
Invalid date/time format. Use yyyy-MM-dd, dd-MM-yyyy, yyyy/MM/dd, dd/MM/yyyy, yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm, dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm, yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm, dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm, yyyy-MM-dd HHmm, dd-MM-yyyy HHmm, yyyy/MM/dd HHmm, or dd/MM/yyyy HHmm. o/T\>
 Noted. I've removed this task:
   [E][ ] planning (from: 2026-08-06 09:00 to: 2026-08-06 10:00)
 Now you have 4 tasks in the list.
```
